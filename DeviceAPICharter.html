<div id="goals">
<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>The Device and Sensors Working Group aims at producing Web client-side APIs that facilitate deeper integration of Web applications into advanced capabilities of their host devices.</p>

<p>These capabilities include access to a camera, microphone, or system information such as network connection and battery level.</p>

<p>Adding these advanced features to the Web environment empowers Web developers to create richer and more context-aware Web applications.</p>

<p>Given the sensitive nature of the data and sensors to which these APIs grant access, the Working Group also aims at crafting APIs that are both secure and privacy-enabling by design, based on the current Web browser security model. This entails reusing existing browser-based security metaphors where they apply and looking into innovative security and privacy mechanisms where they don’t.</p>
</div>

<div class="scope">
<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>

<p>The scope of this Working Group is the creation of API specifications for a
device’s services that can be exposed to Web applications. Services include sensors, media capture, network information and discovery. Devices in this context include desktop computers, laptop computers, mobile Internet devices (MIDs), cellular phones, TVs, cameras and other connected devices.</p>

<p>Devices sometimes provide calendar, contacts and other personal information management services. These services are also in scope for this Working Group, but to work on Specifications in that area the group would need to recharter to add new Deliverables. </p>

<p>Hardware security services are out of scope for this group.</p>

<p>Priority will be given to developing simple and consensual APIs, leaving
more complex features to future versions.</p>

<h3>Success Criteria</h3>

<p>To advance to Proposed Recommendation, each specification is expected to
have two independent implementations of all features defined in the
specification, including implementation on a constrained device (e.g. mobile phone, TV).</p>
<p>APIs that cannot be demonstrated to be implementable securely within the default browser context will not be released.</p>


<p>Each specification should contain a section detailing any known
  security or privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>

<p>Additionally, comprehensive test suites will be developed for each
specification to ensure interoperability, and the group will create
interoperability reports. The group will also maintain errata as required for
the continued relevance and usefulness of the specifications it produces. </p>

<p>Where applicable, each specification should contain a section on accessibility that describes the benefits and impacts, including ways specification features can be used to address them, and recommendations for maximising accessibility in implementations.</p>


</div>

<div class="deliverables">
<h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h2>

<h3 id="rec-track">Normative Specificiations</h3>

<p>Where practical, the API specifications should use the <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WebIDL/">Web IDL</a> formalism.</p>

<h4>Jointly Developed Specifications</h4>

<p>The Working Group may also enter into joint Task Forces with other groups to collaborate on any of the above Deliverables that cross group boundaries.</p>

<h3>Adding new Recommendation-track deliverables</h3>

<p>If additional in-scope Recommendation-track deliverables need to be added to the Charter before the Charter expires, the Working Group will prepare an updated Charter that differs only in deliverables. In the interest of agile spec development, the group requests that the Advisory Committee and Director restrict approval reviews for those Charter deliverables adjustments to just the changes in the Charter, rather than considering the entire Charter again for review.</p>

<p>The Working Group will not adopt new proposals until they have matured through the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/wicg/">Web Platform Incubator Community Group</a> or another similar incubation phase.</p>

<h3>Other Deliverables</h3>

<p>A comprehensive test suite for all features of a specification is necessary
to ensure the specification’s robustness, consistency, and implementability,
and to promote interoperability between User Agents.</p>

<p>The Working Group may also document in a Working Group Note useful
design patterns shared by the APIs it is developing.</p>

<p>Other non-normative documents may be created such as:</p>

<div id="ig-other-deliverables">
<ul>
  <li>Primers</li>
  <li>Requirements and use case documents for specifications</li>
  <li>Non-normative group notes</li>
</ul>

<p>Given sufficient resources, this Working Group should review other working
groups’ deliverables that are identified as being relevant to the Working
Group’s mission. </p>
</div>

<h3>Timeline</h3>


<p><em>Note: The actual production of some of the deliverables may follow a
different timeline. The group documents any schedule changes on the <a
href="https://www.w3.org/2009/dap/">group home page</a></em>.</p>
</div>

<div class="dependencies">
<h2 id="coordination">Coordination</h2>

<h3>W3C Groups</h3>

<p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/Charter.html#horizontal-review">horizontal review</a> for accessibility, internationalization, performance, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/">TAG</a>. Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/Process-20170301/#RecsWD">FPWD</a> and at least 3 months before <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/Process-20170301/#RecsCR">CR</a>, and should be issued when major changes occur in a specification.

  <p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/Process-20170301/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>:</p>

</dl>

<div>
<h3>External Groups</h3>

<p>The following is a tentative list of external bodies the Working Group
should collaborate with: </p>
<dl>
  <dt><a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/memento/TC39.htm"
  id="tc39">Ecma International Technical Committee 39 (TC39)</a></dt>
    <dd>This is the group responsible for EcmaScript standardization, and
      related EcmaScript features like E4X. As this Working Group is
      developing EcmaScript APIs, it should collaborate with TC39.</dd>
  <dt><a href="http://www.ietf.org" id="ietf">IETF</a></dt>
    <dd>The IETF has created specifications that are related to some of the
      APIs in this WG’s scope.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
</div>

<div class="participation">
<h2 id="participation">Participation</h2>

<p>To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 6 or more active
participants for its duration, and to have the participation of the industry
leaders in fields relevant to the specifications it produces. </p>

<p>The Chair(s) and specification Editors are expected to contribute one to two
days per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for
other participants.</p>

<p>Based on the input from the group participants, the Chairs may also decide to create task forces that allow more focused discussions for topics that require specific expertise.</p>

<p>This Working Group will also allocate the necessary resources for building
Test Suites for each specification. </p>

<p>The group
  encourages questions and comments on its public mailing lists  and document repositories, as described in <a href="#communication">Communication</a>.</p>

<p>The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for
consideration upon their agreement to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>. </p>
</div>

<div class="communication">
<h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>

<p>Technical discussions for this Working  Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/Process-20170301/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed on a public repository, and may permit direct public contribution requests. The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.</p>

<p>Information about the group (for example, details about deliverables,
issues, actions, status, participants) is available from the <a
href="https://www.w3.org/2009/dap/">Device and Sensors Working Group
home page.</a> </p>

<p>The Working Group’s Teleconferences focus on discussion of particular
specifications, and are conducted on an as-needed basis.</p>

<p>This group primarily conducts its technical work  on
the <a
href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-device-apis/">public-device-apis@w3.org</a> and on Github issues. The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.</p>

<p>The group uses a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative
purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and participants of the group, for
Member-only discussions in special cases when a particular participant requests such
a discussion. </p>

</div>

<div class="decisions">
<h2 id="decisions">Decision Policy</h2>

<p> This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/Process-20170301/#Consensus">W3C Process Document (section 3.3)</a>. Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>

<p>However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress, but consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote, and record a decision along with any objections.</p>

<p>To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional. A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email and/or web-based survey), with a response period from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue. If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.</p>

<p>All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available, or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.</p>

<p>This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a>, and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.</p>
</div>
