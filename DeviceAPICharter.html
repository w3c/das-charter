<div id="goals">
<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>The Device APIs Working Group aims at producing Web client-side APIs that facilitate deeper integration of Web applications into advanced capabilities of their host devices.</p>

<p>These capabilities include access to a camera, microphone, address book, calendar, or system information such as network connection and battery level.</p>

<p>Adding these advanced features to the Web environment empowers Web developers to create richer and more context-aware Web applications.</p>

<p>Given the sensitive nature of the data and sensors to which these APIs grant access, the Working Group also aims at crafting APIs that are both secure and privacy-enabling by design, based on the current Web browser security model. This entails reusing existing browser-based security metaphors where they apply and looking into innovative security and privacy mechanisms where they don’t.</p>
</div>

<div class="scope">
<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>

<p>The scope of this Working Group is this creation of API specifications for a
device’s services that can be exposed to Web applications . Devices in this context include desktop computers, laptop computers, mobile Internet devices (MIDs), cellular phones, TVs, cameras and other connected devices.</p>

<p>Priority will be given to developing simple and consensual APIs, leaving
more complex features to future versions.</p>

<p>This Working Group’s deliverables must address issues of
<strong><em>accessibility</em></strong>,
<strong><em>internationalization</em></strong>,
<strong><em>mobility</em></strong>, <strong><em>security</em></strong> and <strong><em>privacy</em></strong>. </p>

<p>Additionally, comprehensive test suites will be developed for each
specification to ensure interoperability, and the group will create
interoperability reports. The group will also maintain errata as required for
the continued relevance and usefulness of the specifications it produces. </p>

<h3>Success Criteria</h3>

<p>To advance to Proposed Recommendation, each specification is expected to
have two independent implementations of all features defined in the
specification, including implementation on a constrained device (e.g. mobile phone, TV).</p>
<p>APIs that cannot be demonstrated to be implementable securely within the default browser context will not be released.</p>
</div>

<div class="deliverables">
<h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h2>

<h3 id="rec-track">Recommendation-Track Deliverables</h3>

<h4>Maintenance</h4>
<p>The Working Group will maintain errata and new editions, as necessary, for the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/REC-vibration-20150210/">Vibration API</a> W3C Recommendation.</p>

<p>Where practical, the API specifications should use the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WebIDL/">Web IDL</a> formalism.</p>


<p>The Working Group may also enter into joint Task Forces with other groups to collaborate on specifications that cross group boundaries.</p>

<h3>Adding new Recommendation-track deliverables</h3>

<p>If additional deliverables need to be added to the Charter before the Charter expires, the Working Group will prepare an updated Charter that differs only in deliverables. In the interest of agile spec development, the group requests that the Advisory Committee and Director restrict approval reviews for those Charter deliverables adjustments to just the changes in the Charter, rather than considering the entire Charter again for review.</p>

<h3>Other Deliverables</h3>

<p>A comprehensive test suite for all features of a specification is necessary
to ensure the specification’s robustness, consistency, and implementability,
and to promote interoperability between User Agents.</p>

<p>The Working Group may also document in a Working Group Note the useful
design patterns shared by the APIs it is developing.</p>

<p>Other non-normative documents may be created such as:</p>

<div id="ig-other-deliverables">
<ul>
  <li>Primers</li>
  <li>Requirements and use case document for specifications.</li>
  <li>Non-normative group notes</li>
</ul>

<p>Given sufficient resources, this Working Group should review other working
groups’ deliverables that are identified as being relevant to the Working
Group’s mission. </p>
</div>

<h3>Milestones</h3>

<p><em>Note: The actual production of some of the deliverables may follow a
different timeline. The group documents any schedule changes on the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/2009/dap/">group home page</a></em>.</p>

<h3>External Groups</h3>

<p>The following is a tentative list of external bodies the Working Group
should collaborate with: </p>
<dl>
  <dt><a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/memento/TC39.htm"
  id="tc39">Ecma International Technical Committee 39 (TC39)</a></dt>
    <dd>This is the group responsible for EcmaScript standardization, and

</dl>
</div>
</div>

<div class="participation">
<h2 id="participation">Participation</h2>

<p>To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 10 or more active
participants for its duration, and to have the participation of the industry
leaders in fields relevant to the specifications it produces. </p>

<p>The Chair(s) and specification Editors are expected to contribute one to two
days per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for
other participants.</p>

<p>Based on the input from the group participants, the Chairs may also decide to create task forces that allow more focused discussions for topics that require specific expertise (e.g. PIM APIs).</p>

<p>This Working Group will also allocate the necessary resources for building
Test Suites for each specification. </p>

<p>This Working Group welcomes participation from non-Members. The group
encourages questions and comments on its public mailing list, <a
href="mailto:public-device-apis@w3.org">public-device-apis@w3.org</a>, which is
<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-device-apis/">publicly
archived</a> and for which there is no formal requirement for participation.
The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for
consideration, with the agreement from each participant to Royalty-Free
licensing of those submissions under the W3C Patent Policy. </p>
</div>

<div class="communication">
<h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>

<p>The Working Group’s Teleconferences focus on discussion of particular
specifications, and are conducted on an as-needed basis.</p>

<p>Most of the technical work of the group is done through discussions on
the <a
href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-device-apis/">public-device-apis@w3.org</a>,
the group’s public mailing list. Editors’ drafts and their editing history is available from a public W3C web site. The group’s <i>action</i> and
<i>issue</i> tracking data is also public, as are the participants-approved
<i>minutes</i> from all teleconferences and meetings. </p>

<p>The group uses a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative
purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and participants of the group, for
Member-only discussions in special cases when a particular participant requests such
a discussion. </p>

<p>Information about the group (for example, details about deliverables,
issues, actions, status, participants) is available from the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/2009/dap/">Device APIs Working Group
home page.</a> </p>
</div>

<div class="decisions">
<h2 id="decisions">Decision Policy</h2>

<p>Any resolution taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference is to be considered provisional until 10 working days after the publication of the resolution in draft minutes sent to the working groups mailing list. If no objections are raised on the mailing list within that time, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.</p>

      <p>As explained in the Process Document (<a href="/Consortium/Process/policies#Consensus">section
      3.3</a>), this group seeks to make decisions when there
      is consensus. When the Chair puts a question and observes
      dissent, after due consideration of different opinions, the
      Chair should record a decision (possibly after a formal vote)
      and any objections, and move on.</p>

<p>This charter is written in accordance with <a
href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes">Section 3.4,
Votes</a> of the W3C Process Document and includes no voting procedures beyond
what the Process Document requires. </p>
</div>
